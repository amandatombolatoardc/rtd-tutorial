Definition
==========

The relevant point of contact for requesting access to the data asset (e.g. the data custodian). The point of contact should be enduring (e.g. role-based) as opposed to a specific individual (e.g. a chief investigator).

This may be a different point of contact than that used for enquiries about the data asset (see Enquiries (4.4.1)).

This field will be used by the HeSANDA Federations Service to direct where data requests will be sent. 

The Request Point of Contact will need to be separately registered with ARDC to enable this functionality.
